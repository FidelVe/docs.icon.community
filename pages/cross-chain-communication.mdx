# Cross-chain Communication

The ICON Cross-Chain Framework consists of a robust L1 blockchain, ICON General Message Passing (xCall) and a growing list of connected blockchains and integrated bridging protocols. 

Improved interoperability through this aggregation of bridging protocols allows apps to transform from isolated and ineffective to well-connected and essential. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Avoiding both a declining user base and long development integration timelines. Apps, written in any programming language, can use the ICON Cross-Chain Framework.
